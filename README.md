# 🌐 Professional Portfolio — Israel Q. Villa Jr.

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where I share my journey from **Certified Public Accountant (CPA)** to **Software Engineering**.

After nearly a decade in corporate tax and financial reporting across the Philippines, Qatar, Australia, and the U.S., I began learning how technology can make compliance and data workflows more efficient.  
This portfolio highlights my background, projects, and continuous learning as I build tools that bridge **finance and technology**.
